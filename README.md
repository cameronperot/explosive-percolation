# Explosive Percolation

I am currently writing my bachelor's thesis in the computational physics group at Universit√§t Leipzig under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wolfhard Janke.
Percolation theory is a subject with a range of applications, and can be used to help model phase transitions in systems where there is an underlying graph, e.g. a lattice or random network.
Phase transitions are of great interest in physics as we often study systems which have different phases, such as a ferromagnets which have an ordered ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures and a disordered phase at high temperatures.
To be a bit more specific, I am working on explosive percolation, which entails processes where the graph evolves in such a way that the onset of percolation is delayed until a critical point where there is a sudden onset of large scale connectivity.
